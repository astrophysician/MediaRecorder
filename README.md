This project implements the 1st work package of the "Image Deblurring using 3D Camera Rotation" project in the 3D Photography
course (Spring Semester 2015) of the MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

The goal is to retrieve synchronized video and sensory data from an Android smartphone, to use it for deblurring the original
video by dealing with the 3D rotation of the camera.
